# relativize.vim

This plugin only shows relative line numbers when you need them: in the current
window, and if you're not in insert mode. Otherwise, it will give you the
absolute numbers. As suggested by [Jeff
Kreeftmeijer](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2012/relative-line-numbers-in-vim-for-super-fast-movement/).

## Installation

- Using [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

        cd ~/.vim/bundle
        git clone git://github.com/ericbn/vim-relativize.git

- Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

        Plug 'ericbn/vim-relativize'

## Configuration

Add one of the following to your `.vimrc` depending on the initial look you
want:

- Relative line numbers when you need them:

        set relativenumber

- Relative numbers when you need them, with the absolute line number in the
  current line (requires at least Vim 7.4):

        set number relativenumber

- Absolute line numbers all the time (toggle relative numbers when you need
  them with `:RelativizeToggle`):

        set number

- No numbers at all (use the map below to switch numbers from appearing, will
  first switch to absolute line numbers):

  (nothing)

You can toggle relative line numbers from appearing with `:RelativizeToggle`.
To map a key (e.g. <kbd>F2</kbd>) to this command, add the following to your
`.vimrc`:

    nnoremap <silent> <F2> :RelativizeToggle<CR>

To map a key (e.g. <kbd>F3</kbd>) to switch the numbers from appearing or not
at all, add this to your `.vimrc`:


    nnoremap <silent> <F3> :let [&number, &relativenumber] =
      \ [!&number && (g:relativize_with_number \|\| !g:relativize_enabled),
      \ !&relativenumber && g:relativize_enabled]<CR>

## Why another 'relativenumber' plugin?

This is a no-nonsense plugin with only 27 lines of code. I believe this is how
a plugin for such a simple feature should be. It is flexible, and plays well
with other plugins without the need for extra configuration options.

If you want a plugin that needs more configuration options, try
[numbertoggle](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-numbertoggle),
[numbers.vim](https://github.com/myusuf3/numbers.vim),
[vim-relativity](https://github.com/kennykaye/vim-relativity),
[vim-autonumber](https://github.com/foriequal0/vim-autonumber),
[RelativeNumberCurrentWindow](https://github.com/vim-scripts/RelativeNumberCurrentWindow)
or [smartnumber.vim](https://github.com/mopp/smartnumber.vim).

To have relative line numbering only in operator-pending mode, try
[RelOps](https://github.com/vim-scripts/RelOps).

If you want an even simpler plugin, that will only switch between absolute and
relative line numbers on a mapped key or lead shortcut, try
[toggle-numbers.vim](https://github.com/fullybaked/toggle-numbers.vim) or
[vim-toggle-relative-line-numbers](https://github.com/gangleri/vim-toggle-relative-line-numbers).
